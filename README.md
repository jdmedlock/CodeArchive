# JavaCodeArchive
This repository contains my solutions to interesting and sometimes unique problems using Java. These problems include classic Computer Science algorithms and language-specific exercises I've used to expand my knowledge of the Java language. They also include programs and code snippets I've developed in my career that solve common issues across a variety of applications. All of these range in difficulty from trivial to complex.

My purpose in developing this repository is to:
- Retain and reuse solutions I've developed to common problems.
- Establish a basis for developing similar language-specific archives for new languages I learn.
- Blatantly show peers and prospective employers what I have done and what my coding style is rather than just describing my capabilities in my resume.

The programs included in this repository are:
1. EightQueens.java
This class finds the number ways eight queens can be placed on a chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other. This is a classic problem in both Mathematics and Computer Science that was first posited in the mid-19th century. From a Computer Science standpoint it is interesting since it requires considerable finesse to arrive at an efficient solution and since it demonstrates the power of a recursive solution.
2. WeatherStats.java
WeatherStats demonstrates how to retrieve and parse data from a website using standard Java libraries without resorting to maintaining that data on the local server. In this case weather data from a monitoring station at Lake Pend Oreille in Northeastern Washington is retrieved from a [website](http://lpo.dt.navy.mil) maintained by the U.S. Navy and used to generate basic statistics.
